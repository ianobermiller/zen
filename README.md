Oh Github
=========

Do you know what I'd think was awesome? Well, this writing tool that you've made, I'm using it now - for the first time, and I think it is so subtly amazing that I'm actually enjoying writing this. This README.md file on http://github.com. 

But do you what? 

I can not even wait to start editing code on this, the thought of even starting from scratch  - `to make awesome things using code` just the thought  is making me happy already. And if I'm honest even just writing prose on it is enjoyable, I cant imagine how that must feel - I'm editing a markdown file now in what started as an effort to try out some thing that you've made. And I wont lie its looking good. 

While writing this though for my own enjoyment two things happend. 

* I felt the overwhelming urge to thank someone at github for making this. Which if we're honest with each other dear reader is quite subjective - nice but subjective.

* I realised that I wanted to be able to link to this. Not the main github page of my code repository (although I will want to do that of course) but to this markdown rendered zen mode view of what I want to show them, be that code or prose.

* And as a side effect of trying out something I saw that looked interesting and turned out to be brilliant, I thought wouldn't be great if, when editing markdown all lines that my cursor wasn't on, reverted to the actual markdown result?
Thereby allowing me to stay "ine the zone" in a zen like undisturbed state while crafting the thing I want to craft using a simple (read: Gets out of my way but lets me do what I need to do when I need to do it) yet beautiful tool to both write and write code.

If you got this far and you've not actually used Github's new zen writing tool, I seriously suggest you do ( here's [the link](https://github.com/blog/1379-zen-writing-mode), even if its just to [see how this page that I typed looked so amazing that I couldn't help but write it](https://github.com/christopherdebeer/zen/blob/master/README.md).

Thank you whoever made this. Thank you very much.

You've impressed me. and I don't doubt there will be many many people who work with text on the web that will be as grateful as me that you've given it to them for free.

This thing is brilliant. _See above_. I hope someone working at github.com reads this, if only to express to them how much I love this thing that they've made writing code.

``` As an after thought you should check out the first commit message of this file. I've pasted after this block using one of githubs nice little features (read: UX tid bit)```
